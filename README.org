#+TITLE: delve.el

Delve is a tool to delve into your [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org roam zettelkasten]]. Currently,
you can browse your zettelkasten by tag, or use one of the predefined
searches. Delve inherits and extends the functionality from the now
deprecated [[https://github.com/publicimageltd/org-roam-dashboard][org-roam-dashboard]].

* Features

 - Display lists of org roam pages (=Zettel) with additional
   information on backlinks, "tolinks", and modification date.
 - Expand the Zettel item (page) to see backlinks, or links pointing
   to the zettel, or both.
 - Interactively browse the Zettelkasten according to predefined
   searches (Last ten modified pages; top linked pages; etc.)
 - Visit the Zettel at point to edit it. Delve provides an interactive
   command to switch back and forth between the Delve buffers and the
   org roam buffers.
 - Remote editing: From within the tree view, add or remove tags.
 - Additional minor mode (delve-minor-mode) for org roam pages,
   allowing to open a new Delve buffer with the current org roam page
   as top item.

* Installation

Delve depends on another tool of mine called [[https://github.com/publicimageltd/lister][lister]]. But neither
package is available at melpa yet. So you have to download both packes
(delve and lister) in order to make this work:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package lister
  :quelpa (lister :fetcher git :branch "main"
  		  :url "https://github.com/publicimageltd/lister"))

(use-package delve
  :quelpa (delve :fetcher git :branch "main"
		 :url "https://github.com/publicimageltd/delve")
  :config
  (use-package delve-minor-mode
    :config
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'delve-minor-mode-maybe-activate))
  :bind
  (("<f12>" . delve-open-or-select)))

  #+end_src
